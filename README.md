# SMS Spam Detection with Various NLP Techniques

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the application of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect spam messages in a dataset. The following techniques are implemented:

- Bag of Words (BoW)
- Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- Word2Vec (Average Word2Vec)

## 1. Setup and Data Loading

In this section, we will install the necessary packages and load the dataset.

## 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

We will clean and preprocess the data by removing non-alphabetic characters, converting text to lowercase, and removing stopwords. Stemming will also be applied.

## 3. Bag of Words Model

In this section, we will create a Bag of Words model and evaluate its performance using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

## 4. TF-IDF Model

We will create a TF-IDF model and evaluate its performance using both a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and a Random Forest classifier.

## 5. Word2Vec Model

In this section, we will create a Word2Vec model from scratch, apply average Word2
